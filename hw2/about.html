                <li>History
                    <p>
                        This store was formed in 2006 by Mac Layton and his close friend Kyle Varan. They both saw the
                        need for higher quality t-shirt that could be custom made to fit their customers perfectly.
                        They started the business by renting out an old warehouse and using a hot iron to press onto
                        blank shirts. In 2007 they were not making a lot of money and had to stop production for 3
                        months. After hearing of this, a friend invested in the businesses advertisement
                        initiative and boosted sales tenfold. Once they gained more business they needed a better way
                        to manage their orders so
                        a website was created and they now ship all over the US. Tee Time started out with only
                        two employees in one state and has grown to 30 employees in two states. This has all occurred
                        in
                        only a 12 year span and is currently growing at a 13% rate every year!

                <li>Philosophy
                    <p>
                        Our philosophy at Tee Time is to provide customers with the best quality at the best
                        price. We know how frustrating it can be to go to the store as well as the pains associated
                        with ordering clothes online. Because of this, we have a 100% guarantee on all of our products
                        and if it doesn't fit or you just don't like it, send it back on us!
                    </p>
