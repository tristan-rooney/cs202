    <h1>What is a Programming Language?</h1>
    <p>
      A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for 
      instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to 
      high-level languages, such as <span class="language">C</span>, <span class="language">Java</span>, or 
      <span class="language">JavaScript</span> rather than low-level languages
      such as <span class="language">assembly</span> or <span class="language">micro-code</span>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are hundreds of programming languages that differ in syntax and paradigm.  The major extant language paradigms
      are listed below.
    </p>

    <ul class="paradigm-list">
      <li>Functional</li>
      <li>Imperative</li>
      <li>Logical</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      The question of which language is the <em class="sq">best</em> one
      to use is a matter of frequent and wide-ranging debate among computer programmers.
      But, of course, it turns out that the best language is the one that is best
      able to solve the problem that you want solved at the moment.  A famous computer
      scientist said that <q cite="http://www.defprogramming.com/quotes-by/c-a-r-hoare/">
      The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user.</q>
      <span class="pls"></span> exists to advance both the understanding and 
      expressive power of programming languages.

          <p>
            In computer science, functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and, as such, avoids the notion
            of state.  It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of state-changing
            statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function 
            <span class="eqn"><var>f</var></span> twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result <span class="eqn"><var>f</var>(<var>x</var>)</span> each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following <span class="language">Haskell</span> program gives an example.
          </p>

          <code>fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)</code>

          <p>
            John McCarthy, a computer scientist who helped design the foundation of today’s Internet-based computing and who is 
            widely credited with coining the term for a frontier of research he helped pioneer, Artificial Intelligence, or A.I., 
            was one of the early proponents of functional programming.

          <p>
           Imperative programming uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the 
           imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands 
           for the computer to perform. Each executable command changes the internal program state.  
         </p>

         <p>
          The following <span class="language">C</span> program gives an example.
        </p>

<code>int fib(int n) {
  if (n &lt;= 1) {
    return n; 
  } else {
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); 
  }
}
</code>

  <p>
    John Warner Backus directed the team that invented and implemented <span class="language">FORTRAN</span>, the first widely used 
    high-level impereative programming language, and was the inventor of the Backus–Naur form (BNF), a widely used notation to 
    define formal language syntax. He later did research into the function-level programming paradigm, presenting his 
    findings in his influential 1977 Turing Award lecture "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?

  <p>
    Logic programming is based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences 
    in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Major logic programming language families include 
    <span class="language">Prolog</span>, <span class="language">Answer set programming (ASP)</span> and <span class="language">Datalog</span>.

    Alain Colmerauer was the center of a research group that, in the early 1970s, first conceived of <span class="language">Prolog</span>, 
    a general-purpose logic programming language rooted in first-order logic that is well-suited for tasks that benefit from rule-based logical 
    queries such as searching databases, voice control systems, and filling templates.
